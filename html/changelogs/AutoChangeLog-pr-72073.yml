changes:
  - rscadd: "Carp will now run away if their health gets low, meaning they may have a chance to regenerate."
  - rscadd: "Lia will now fight back if attacked instead of letting herself get killed, watch out!"
  - balance: "Magicarp will now aim their spells more intelligently."
  - rscadd: "Tame Magicarp can be ordered to use their spells on things."
  - refactor: "Carp are now \"Basic Mobs\" instead of \"Simple Mobs\""
  - bugfix: "Dehydrated carp no longer give you a bad feeling when they're your friend and a good feeling when they're going to attack you."
  - balance: "Tamed carp are now friendly only to their tamer rather than their whole faction, which should make dehydrated carp more active. Order them to stay or follow you if you want them to behave around your friends."
